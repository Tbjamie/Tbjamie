# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About me

My name is Jamie Tirbeni, and I am currently in my second year as a Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA). My studies in CMD merge my two greatest passions: coding and designing engaging websites and apps.

Within CMD, we not only learn how to make websites user-friendly but also how to aesthetically craft them. It's fascinating to explore how design and functionality go hand in hand to create a seamless user experience.

I am driven to further develop my skills and grow in the field of front-end development. I am familiar with using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I am open to new challenges by learning frameworks as well as back end!

Let's explore and shape the world of the web together! 🌐💻✨
